The finance team of Rossmann pharmaceuticals wants to forecast sales in all their stores across several cities six weeks ahead of time. Managers in individual stores rely on their years of experience as well as their personal judgement to forcast sales. So this project serves an end-to-end product that delivers this prediction to analysts in the finance team.
